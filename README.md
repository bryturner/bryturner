Hello All,</br></br>
My name is Bryan and I currently reside in the beautiful state of Colorado. At the moment, I have experience using React, JavaScript, CSS and HTML on the front end. I have also worked with Node.js, MongoDB and Express on the back end.   </br> </br>
At this point, my focus is to learn more about underlying algorithms that make everything work and the best ways to use them in different situations. I have always been a believer that
understanding how things work at the base level and building up from there is one of the best ways to learn. It may be a bit slower at first, but in the long run, it always pays off. </br></br>
I am open to working on anything that fits with my skill level and where my contribution will be meaningful.
